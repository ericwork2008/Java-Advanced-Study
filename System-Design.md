# Four Steps for the System Design
Step 1.  Constraints and use cases (Requirement & Use Case clarify)
	Clarify the system's constraints and to identify what use cases the system needs to satisfy.
	
Step 2: Abstract design, core system class and overview arch
	 try to address every constraint and use case.
	 
Step 3: Understanding bottlenecks Or Issues

Step 4: Scaling your abstract design/Close issues

## System design need think about following aspects
- Ease to use
- Flexibility for future changing or demands requirements
- Scalability
- Efficiency
- Different domain system many have different issues need care. For network server, we need think about balance/huge user/etc.
