# Steps for a Solution <a name="solution_steps"></a>
	 1) Analysis Problem, Do it by example, find solution way. 
	 2) Brute Force OR Get the special properties in the solution to Optimize
	 3) Find & Simplify to a reasonable Math Model (Data Structure & Algorithm)
	 4) Implement by Code
	 5) Test
## How to design&develope an algorithm <a name="dev_algo"></a>
---
In Crack Coding, it have following way to design an algorithm
1) Look for BUD (Bottleneck, Unneccecary Operation, Duplicated Operations)
2) DIY
3) Simplify and Generalize
4) Basecase and build
5) Brainstorm of Data structure
6) Check if we used all information we know.
7) Trace Table and Virtualize Path is tools to develop the algorithm
