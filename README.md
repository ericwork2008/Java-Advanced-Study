## Varargs parameter
The three dots can only be used in a method argument, and are called 'varargs'. It means you can pass in an array of parameters without explicitly creating the array.

## Java Object Initialization/Finalizer
1) JVM will create a default constructor if code doesn't define one
2) Static initial block will be called before constructor. One class can have multiple initial blocks
3) Java static variables will be ininitialized to default value.
4) Garbage collection cannot make sure finalize called on time. 
5) Java 7 introduced try-with-resources & AutoCloseable interface to free the resource automatically.
