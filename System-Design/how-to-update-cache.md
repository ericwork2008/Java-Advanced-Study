# How to update cache

Updating the cache in a database design is an important aspect of maintaining data consistency and performance. Caching is used to store frequently accessed data in memory, so it can be quickly retrieved without the need to fetch it from the underlying database every time. Here are some common strategies and techniques for updating the cache in a database design:

1. **Cache Invalidation**:
   * The most common approach is cache invalidation. When data in the database changes (through inserts, updates, or deletes), the corresponding data in the cache is marked as invalid or outdated.
   * When a request for that data comes in, the system checks if it's in the cache. If it's invalid, it fetches the updated data from the database and updates the cache with the new data.
   * This approach ensures that cached data remains relatively fresh, but it requires careful synchronization to ensure that the cache is updated whenever the underlying data changes.
2. **Time-Based Cache Expiration**:
   * Another approach is to set a time limit on how long data is considered valid in the cache. After this time period, the data is automatically considered stale.
   * When a request for data is made, the system checks if the data is still within its expiration time. If it is, it serves the cached data; otherwise, it fetches fresh data from the database.
   * This method reduces the frequency of cache updates but may serve slightly outdated data until the cache expires.
3. **Write-Through and Write-Behind Caches**:
   * In write-through caching, every write operation to the database is also reflected in the cache. This ensures that the cache always contains up-to-date data.
   * In write-behind caching, writes are first made to the cache, and then asynchronously, the data is written to the database. This can provide better write performance but may introduce temporary inconsistencies between the cache and the database.
4. **Cache Queues**:
   * Some systems use a queue-based approach to manage cache updates. When a change is made to the database, a message is placed in a queue.
   * Background processes consume messages from the queue and update the cache accordingly. This decouples the cache update process from the main application, which can help in handling high write loads.
5. **Cache Busting**:
   * For scenarios where it's difficult to track individual data changes, a "cache busting" technique can be used. In this approach, the entire cache is periodically cleared and rebuilt from the database.
   * This ensures that the cache always contains the most recent data but can be resource-intensive and lead to performance spikes during cache rebuilds.
6. **Event-Driven Updates**:
   * In some cases, you can use event-driven architectures to trigger cache updates. Whenever a relevant change occurs in the database, an event is published, and cache components subscribe to these events to update their caches accordingly.

The choice of caching strategy depends on your specific use case, performance requirements, and the architecture of your system. Often, a combination of these techniques may be used to optimize cache management in complex database designs.
