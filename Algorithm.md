# Big O (for Time and Space complexity)
---
Big O is an upper bound on time
Big omega is the lower bound
big theta means both O & omega

Normally we think about three case for Big O analysis: best/worse/Excepted

Recursive function that makes multiple calls, the runtime will often look like O(branch^depth)

# How to design&develope an algorithm

In Crack Coding, it have following way to design an algorithm
1) Look for BUD (Bottleneck, Unneccecary Operation, Duplicated Operations)
2) DIY
3) Simplify and Generalize
4) Basecase and build
5) Brainstorm of Data structure
6) Check if we used all information we know.
