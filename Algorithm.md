#Big O (for Time and Space complexity)
---
Big O is an upper bound on time
Big omega is the lower bound
big theta means both O & omega

Normally we think about three case for Big O analysis: best/worse/Excepted

Recursive function that makes multiple calls, the runtime will often look like O(branch^depth)
